#Sell Foop for the web
This is a repository containing the source code for the classic Linux game "Swell Foop" based on web technologies.

**Note:** *I started the project to familiarize myself with both coffeescript and the HTML-Canvas which is why it's currently still far from finished and less than optimal.*

###Setup
* Set yourself up with npm (comes with node.js)
* You'll need the coffeescript transpiler. Install with ```npm install -g coffee-script```
* Other than that, a web browser is all you need
